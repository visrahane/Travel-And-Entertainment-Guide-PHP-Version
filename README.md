Technical details:

<i>Backend</i>: 
The backend is a PHP code which calls google apis for places details, photos and reviews. The photos are stored on a server for a particular search so that subsequent calls to the same location returns results faster.

<i>Frontend</i>:
Nothing fancy! Plain CSS, HTML and JS. No frameworks used in this version of the project. AJAX calls are made to PHP backend to fetch results.
